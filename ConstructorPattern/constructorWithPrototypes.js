//Constructor with prototype

// Functions, like almost all objects in JavaScript, 
// contain a "prototype" object. When we call a 
// JavaScript constructor to create an object, 
// all the properties of the constructor's 
// prototype are then made available to the new object.
// In this fashion, multiple Car objects can be created 
// which access the same prototype. 
// We can thus extend the original example as follows:

function Car( model, year, miles ) {
 
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
  this.miles = miles;
 
}

// Note here that we are using Object.prototype.newMethod rather than
// Object.prototype so as to avoid redefining the prototype object
Car.prototype.toString = function () {
  return this.model + " has done " + this.miles + " miles";
};

// Usage:
 
var civic = new Car( "Honda Civic", 2009, 20000 );
var mondeo = new Car( "Ford Mondeo", 2010, 5000 );
 
console.log( civic.toString() );
console.log( mondeo.toString() );

// Above, a single instance of toString() 
// will now be shared between all of the Car objects.
